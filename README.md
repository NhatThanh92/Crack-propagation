# Crack Propagation 
This project concentrated on investigating tibial bone fractures, both with and without implants, aiming to furnish objective and quantitative measures for a deeper comprehension of the complete crack trajectory and fracture mechanics. The methodology employed the Extended Finite Element Method (X-FEM) integrated into Code Aster.

X-FEM enables the simulation of crack initiation and propagation along arbitrary paths without necessitating remeshing.

## Fracture Mechanics Analysis under Monotonic and Cyclic Loading Conditions:
### 1. Under monotonic loading:
   Incorporate the shape of the crack, such as elliptic, demi-planar, or circular, at the location where crack initiation is assumed. Under monotonic loading conditions, it was assumed that a crack would propagate instantaneously once the stress intensity factor (K) or energy release rate (G) reached a critical value denoted as ùêæIùëê or ùê∫ùëê.

### 2. Under cyclic loading conditions:
   Crack initiation occurs at a critical point, pinpointed as the location where fatigue damage peaks. At this juncture, damage accrues during cyclic loading, potentially leading to crack formation.

   Furthermore, fatigue damage, represented by D = 1/N, can be inferred from the number of cycles N, determined through interpolation from an endurance diagram, commonly known as the W√∂hler curve (or S‚ÄìN curve).

   Finally, incorporate the shape of the crack at the critical point and conduct comprehensive crack analysis (Ki, G) and crack propagation analysis.
